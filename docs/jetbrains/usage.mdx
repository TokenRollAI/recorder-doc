# Usage

### Attention!!!

1. Recorder depends on Git, so you must ensure that your project is managed by Git.
2. For the best results, it is recommended to record on a brand new branch with no stashed changes to get the cleanest diff.


### Start Recording

You won't believe how easy it is to use Recorder. Just click `Start Recording` in the bottom right corner.

### Write Code

Here, you just need to write your code as you normally would. Recorder will record your actions without any intrusion.


### Stop Recording

It's not difficult, just click `Stop` again.

If the recording is completed successfully, there will be an `operation.json` file in the root directory of your project.

### Generate SOP-SPEC

Open the chat box of your AI IDE, and select a mode with write permissions (e.g., Agent mode in an AI-powered IDE like Cursor).

Then enter: `call generate_operation_md and follow the instruction`

Wait for the AI to execute, and it will eventually generate a corresponding md file in the `.spec` directory.
