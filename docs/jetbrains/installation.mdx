# install the recorder plugin

Unfortunately, due to the author's limited skills and the unexpected difficulty of Jetbrains plugin development, the recorder plugin is currently unable to be listed on the official marketplace because it uses a deprecated API.

[Plugin Page](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/28059-recorder?noRedirect=true)

Therefore, we provide the plugin [download link](https://github.com/TokenRollAI/recorder-jetbrains/releases/latest) here.

### How to use

Settings -> Plugin -> Plugin Settings -> Install Plugin from Disk -> recorderxxx.zip
