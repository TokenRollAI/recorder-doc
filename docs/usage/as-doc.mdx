You can use Recorder as a doc generator.

All you need to do is:
1. Turn on the recording button
2. Coding
3. Turn off the recording button

Then you will get a `operation.json` file, which contains all your operations.

Then you can use this file to do anything you want. For example, you can use it to generate a SOP document.
