**Our slogan: [Just Do Once](https://recorder.tokenroll.ai/blog/just-do-once) Freeing humans from repetitive work!**

[Zen of SOP Coding](https://recorder.tokenroll.ai/blog/sop-coding)

Recorder is a development tool designed to eliminate the repetitive "screw-turning" tasks in your daily workflow. Instead of manually creating new APIs, components, database tables, or boilerplate SQL, Recorder learns from you once and automates the process forever.

### Core Concept

The philosophy is to capture the pattern of a repetitive development task *one time*.

-   **Record**: Start the recorder and perform a common task, like creating a new API endpoint in your framework.
-   **Generate**: Recorder analyzes the steps you took—creating files, modifying code, running commands—and creates a reusable, parameterized template.
-   **Automate**: The next time you need to do a similar task, you simply invoke the recorder with new parameters (e.g., a different model name), and it generates all the necessary boilerplate code and configuration for you.

### How It Works

1.  **Operation Recording**: The tool integrates with your IDE to capture file changes, terminal commands, and other actions.
2.  **Structured Log (`operation.json`)**: Your actions are saved into a machine-readable `operation.json` log. This captures the "what" and "how" of the task.
3.  **Code & SOP Generation**: Recorder processes the log to generate not just a step-by-step guide (SOP), but more importantly, the actual boilerplate code for your new API, component, or database migration.
