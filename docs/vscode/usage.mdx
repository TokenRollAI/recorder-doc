# Usage

### IMPORTANT!!!

1.  recorder depends on Git. You must ensure your project is under Git version control.
2.  For the best results, it is recommended to start recording on a clean branch with no stashed changes. This ensures the cleanest possible diff.

### Start Recording

You won't believe how simple it is to use recorder. Just click `Start Recording` in the bottom-left corner.

### Write Code

At this stage, you just need to write your code as you normally would. Recorder will record your actions without any intrusion.

### Stop Recording

Just as easy, click `Stop` again.

If the recording completes successfully, an `operation.json` file will be created in the root directory of your project.

### Generate SOP-SPEC

Open the chat panel in your AI IDE and select a mode with write permissions (e.g., Cursor's or AugmentCode's Agent mode).

Then, enter: `call generate_operation_md and follow the instruscion`

Wait for the AI to execute. It will eventually generate a corresponding Markdown file in the `.spec` directory.
