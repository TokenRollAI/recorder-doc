# Installation

Because recorder requires high-level permissions in VS Code, such as accessing terminal input commands and their output, it is currently not available on the official Microsoft Marketplace. You can download it from Open VSX.

[Download Link](https://open-vsx.org/extension/TokenRollAI/recorder)
or use Github's [release](https://github.com/TokenRollAI/recorder/releases/latest)

If you are using Cursor, Wind-IDE, or Trae, you are likely using Open VSX by default.

**You can also search for `recorder` in the VS Code extension marketplace.**

If you cannot find it via search, you can install it manually.
